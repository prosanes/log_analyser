We use git flow to develop.
We use two thumbs up to accept a merge request. If you are the last one to see a MR with two thumbs up, please merge it.
We use gitlab issues and Milestones.
Ww are currently using Gitlab Wall as the main communication system. Maybe later we can decide to migrate to something else, like slack, emails or irc.
We are cool.
But sometime we are boring.
